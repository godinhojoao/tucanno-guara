- There is a website about the animals of south Brazil that will be used in high school and elementary school biology classes.
- I developed this website as part of my Technological initiation scholarship at IFSUL - Campus Bagé. All content is managed by a teacher called Aline Jaime Leal who has a master's degree in agricultural microbiology and a doctorate in education and science. And all design was made by João Augusto an UX/UI designer.

## What is the backend ?

- A CMS called <a href="https://hygraph.com/">Hygraph</a> that has a free plan with 1 million api calls per month.
